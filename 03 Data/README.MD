#Security controls for data

Data security includes securing data explicitly from users and also service principals. Data stores should not be accessible from any other network apart from an explicitly approved one. The virtual network(VNET) should be separated and only certain workloads need to be approved for access. The managed identities should have very specific roles to do the right operations on them
